# Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms studied under the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** course.

## Dynamic Programming (DP)

### 1. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- Implementation: `DP/LCS/lcs.cpp`
- Description: Computes LCS between two sequences (e.g., DNA sequences) and prints the cost matrix, LCS length, and subsequence.
- Technique: Dynamic Programming

### 2. Longest Repeated Subsequence (LRS)
- Implementation: `DP/LRS/lrs.cpp`
- Description: Computes LRS within a single string, prints the cost matrix, LRS length, and subsequence.
- Technique: Dynamic Programming

## How to Compile and Run

### LCS
```bash
cd DP/LCS
g++ lcs.cpp -o lcs
./lcs
